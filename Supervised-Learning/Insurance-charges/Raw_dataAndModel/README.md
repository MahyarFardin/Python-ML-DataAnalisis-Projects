# Over viwe

In this project I tries to predict peoples insurance charges.

# Problems faced

I did not get a good result thats because of my dataset. When you see my dataset you may get two ideas :

- There is a linear target feature which is really noisiy
- There is a target feature which could be seperated and could be fit with 3 lines

but I countinued with the first aspect which was not the best choise.

- Models were untuned
- labels were not scaled

# Features

- sex	
- bmi(*body mass index*)
