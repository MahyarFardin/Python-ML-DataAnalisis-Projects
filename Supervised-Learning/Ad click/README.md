# Ad click project with Random Forest and Decision tree

In this project I tried to predict whether some one with some given information
will click on an advertisement on the internet or not.

## Features of dataset 
- Daily Time Spent on Site: daily Time Spent on Site by users
- Age: age of the users
- Area Income: income of the users
- Daily Internet Usage
- Ad Topic Line: the text written on the add's title
- City: City of the users
- Male: whether they are male or not
- Country: Country of the users
- Timestamp: time of the day they clicked on the Ad
- Clicked on Ad: whether or not they clicked on the add

## Walkthrough
Here I explaine my notebook file

**step 1**: Loading data and extracting some information from it about attributes


**step 2**:Preprocessing:

- Finding missing values using a heatmap
- Finding correlation of attributes
- Removeing non-numeric values ( *in another project I will replcae them with numeric values to see that whether it will increase the accuracy or not* )

**step 3**:Appling all of the models
