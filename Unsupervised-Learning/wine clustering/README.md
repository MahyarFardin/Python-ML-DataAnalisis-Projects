# Clustering wine  

In this project I tried to cluster my data which is a data clustered differante type of wine.

# Problems faced

As I mentioned at the last part of my notebook my data was so tight, so my model could not act well on some points.

# Walkthrough

- First I id preprocessing and I imported my data manually
- Then I applied my kmeans model 
- At last I tried to plot my data to see the results(*there is no straight forward way to evaluate clustering models so I thought of this model to compare them at least visually*)
- I tryed to find the reason for those wrong points
