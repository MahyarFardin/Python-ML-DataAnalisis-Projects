# Overviwe
This is a clustering project in which I tired to cluser a dataset of mall custumers in differant financial groups.

# Features

- CustomerID 	
- Gender 	
- Age 	
- Annual Income (k$) 	
- Spending Score (1-100)

# Walkthrough

I have been done data analysis on this project so I knew everything previously. I jumped into the clustering using kmeans after I reduced
dimetions to visualize my data in order to visually see whether I can cluster or not. Then I tried to find the best cluster number using elbow method
(I could use silhouette method but since it is time consuming I did not)
