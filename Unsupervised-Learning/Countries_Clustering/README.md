# Clustering wine  

In this project I tried to cluster my data which is a general dataset of countries.


# Walkthrough

- removed outliers based on the histogram
- scaled data using standard scaler
- partial decompose data to lowel my features with 95 precent variance
- kmeans model(I used it because I needed 3 clusters also I did not conture iertia)
- evaluated model visually

# Results
