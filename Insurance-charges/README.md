# Over viwe

In this project I tries to predict peoples insurance charges using Linear regression.

# Problems faced

As you see I did not get a good result thats because of my dataset. When you see my dataset you may get two ideas :

- There is a linear dataset which is really noisiy
- There is a dataset which could be seperated and could be fit with 3 lines

but I countinued with the first aspect which was not the best choise.

# Features
- age	
- sex	
- bmi(*body mass index*)
- children 
- smoker
- region	
- charges

# Walkthrough

I imported my dataset and I tried to gather some general information about dataset. Then I replaced non-numeric values with numeric ones; and I gathered more information.
Finally I did a split and trained,tested my linear regression model and I evaluated it.
